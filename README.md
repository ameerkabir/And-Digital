## Approach

### Features
With the time given, I have chosen a combination of features, decided on how
the structure of the application should look like and focus on the functionalities of the app. I then followed agile development approach to develop the application.

### Tech used
    HTML, CSS, ES6, JavaScript.


### Application architecture
######The tool consist of three file 
   `index.html` contains the markup, style tags and the script tag.
   `index.css`  contains all the styles.
   `index.js`  contains all the script that makes the magic.
