## Approach

### Features
With the time given, I have chosen a combination of features, decided on how
the structure of the application should look like and focus on the functionalities of the tool. I then followed agile development approach to develop the application.

### Tech used
    HTML, CSS, ES6, JavaScript.


### Application architecture
###### The tool consist of three file 
   `index.html` contains the markup, style tags and the script tag.


   `index.css`  contains all the styles.


   `index.js`  contains all the script that makes the magic.

 The tool shows Candidates with common skill set in a table represented by the candidate name and skills owned in a comma separated format.


### Future improvements
I'd like to keep expanding this project to hone my existing skills, as well as to explore new technologies


Add Webpack to bundle all the files and configure Hot Module Replacement(HMR).


Improve UI for better user experience, changing the layout to accommodate smaller screen devices(responsive design).


Add unit test aiming for maximum coverage.


Making it as accessible as possible.
